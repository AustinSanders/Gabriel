"A C2 architecture is a network of components hooked together by connectors.  Components and connectors may be added
to an architecture, removed from it, welded together, and detached from one another.  Hierarchical architectures are
supported by allowing an entire architecture to act as a single component in a new, bigger architecture."


The original C2 framework (C2.FW) was developed and implemented by Nenad Medvidovic, Nikunj Mehta, and Marija 
Mikic-Rakic {neno,mehta,marija}@usc.edu.

The original C2 framework was written in C++, Ada, and Java.  Our re-envisioned framework is implemented in Python,
and has been heavily influenced by the original C2 Framework.  Though our framework is primarily based on the original 
C2.FW, it is not intended to be a direct port, and divergences in design decisions are expected to arise.
