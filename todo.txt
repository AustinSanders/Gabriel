Need to add ArchitectureManager which can 'see' all the connections between elements, make new
connections, remove connections, and send out events which tell elements to cease or resume
activity. How the elements actually respond to these events is still up to the element, but we
should likely provide a default behavior. (Austin)

Basic connector behavior should be provided simply by defining a 'run' method in the connector
class.

ArchElements should wrap what behavior they are passed with a loop that listens for messages sent by
the ArchitectureManager.
